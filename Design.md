# Casino Heist
## Introduction:
 Card Casters is a real time deck building rogue lite, where you, a novice dealer, has been tasked with eradicating the corrupt Card Masters iron hold on the land of casinos you live in. Enter his domain, and fight through increasingly dense waves of difficult enemies, including animated slot machines, deadly playing cards, and malevolent shuffling machines. Face various bosses, and gain new cards, which will work as your weapons, utility, and consumable items. Draw your cards in rounds of three, but use them wisely, because enemies will have typing, and will be weak to, resistant to, immune to, or neutral to different kinds of attacks. As is standard with roguelites, upon your death, you will be forced to restart your whole run and try again. Health and regeneration resources will be incredibly scarce, so dodging will be your main defense. The game will be top-down, but the graphics style is TBD.
